## Java Basic Web App

This repository contains the code for a basic web application developed using Java and related technologies. This project was created by following the Pluralsight tutorial [https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/java-basic-web-app/description].

## Description

This web application serves as an introductory project to Java web development. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of building a web application, including handling HTTP requests, managing routes, and rendering dynamic content. This web app specifically focuses on bookstore management, allowing users to view a list of books with their titles, authors, and names. The list can be updated by adding a book, deleting an existing one, or even editing the details of a book in the list.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** Core programming language for server-side development.
- **Servlets:** Java servlets are used to handle HTTP requests and generate responses.
-  **JavaServer Pages (JSP):** JSP technology enables the development of dynamic, Java-based web pages.
- **HTML/CSS:** Frontend structure and styling.
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system used for data storage.

## Database Information
Please note that this project utilizes a local database hosted on the developer's machine. This means the database runs on the developer's local PC, and the web application interacts with this local database for data storage. As a result:

- **Limited Accessibility:** The database is accessible only from the developer's local environment, restricting external access.

- **** This repository is primarily intended for showcasing the developer's fundamental web development skills using Java. 
  
## Deployment Considerations
As of now, the project has not been deployed for the following reasons:

- **Database Dependency:** The reliance on a local database makes it challenging to seamlessly deploy the project in a state where it can function as intended for other users. Configuring a remote database for deployment requires additional setup.

While it's not deployed, developers can still clone the repository and explore the code.
